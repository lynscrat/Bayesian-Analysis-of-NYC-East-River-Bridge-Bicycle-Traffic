# Bayesian-Analysis-of-NYC-East-River-Bridge-Bicycle-Traffic
This project performs a Bayesian analysis to predict the number of bicyclists crossing the East River bridges in New York City based on weather conditions and the day of the week. The analysis uses data from April 2016 and builds a multivariate Poisson regression model using JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler).
